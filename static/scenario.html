            In accordance with the project requirement to seamlessly merge diverse datasets, Research Integration Solutions Inc. spearheads efforts in pioneering research data integration within the educational domain. The main purpose is to integrate data from different sources to facilitate comprehensive analysis and insights. With a focus on clarity and efficiency, documentation of metadata for the mapping project is undertaken. The data source, <span style="color: blue;">http://researchdata.csv</span>, which is one of the CSV files being collected from various departments, forms the foundation of integration work.
          </p>

            Under the guidance of the researchers, uplift mapping is being created. Notably, the decision was made to develop a new mapping from scratch. Quality metrics from <span style="color: blue;">http://example.org/research_quality_metrics</span> was used, the mapping is developed from February 15 to March 31, 2024, using automated RML-based transformations to standardize data into RDF format. The resulting mapping can be found at <span style="color: blue;">http://researchdataintegration.org/uplift_mapping_v1.0</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Validation testing completed by April 15, 2024, successful results have been achieved, validating the accuracy of the RDF output.
          </p>
          <p>
            Excitingly, Research Integration Solutions Inc. releases Version 1.0 of the uplift mapping on April 20, 2024. Published versions of the mapping can be found at the website of the publisher, which is: <span style="color: blue;">http://researchintegrationsolutions.org/uplift_mapping_publisher</span>.
