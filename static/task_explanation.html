              <h2>Welcome to the Usability Experiment for the MetaSEMAP Tool</h2>
         <p>This page outlines the tasks you will perform during the experiment. The tasks are designed to annotate an RML mapping file with metadata provided in a given scenario. Completion of the tasks, along with a subsequent questionnaire, is expected to take approximately 20 minutes.</p> 
          <p>You will need to download an RML mapping file and read a straightforward scenario outlining the project that led to the creation of this mapping file. The necessary metadata for annotating the mapping file can be extracted directly from the scenario.</p>

            <p>
                You are invited to participate in a study on Metadata for semantic/data mappings. This research aims to annotate mappings with a set of metadata fields to enhance their discovery, reusability, and quality assessment. As part of the Ph.D. in Computer Science requirements at Trinity College Dublin, this study is being conducted.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>PROCEDURES OF THIS STUDY: </h5>
                Participants with varying levels of experience in semantic and data mapping are welcome. In this experiment, participants will be asked to provide their consent before beginning the annotation process. They will receive detailed guidance and scenarios on how to upload mapping files and annotate them with a set of metadata fields. Subsequently, participants will complete a questionnaire to evaluate the usability of the system. They will also be asked to provide feedback on the tool's interface design and functionality. The research will involve storing and processing the annotated mappings and questionnaire results for a period of two years, after which they will be deleted to preserve research integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h5>ANONYMITY: </h5>Participant anonymity will be rigorously maintained throughout this experiment. Responses collected will be anonymized and analyzed solely for the refinement and improvement of the MetaMap tool. It is important to note that collected responses will not be linked to any individual participant. Research findings will be disseminated through academic journals, conference proceedings, and within a Ph.D. dissertation at Trinity College Dublin.
